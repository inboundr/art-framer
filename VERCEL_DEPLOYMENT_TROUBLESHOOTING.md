# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue

The build completes successfully but fails during the "Deploying outputs..." phase with:

```
An unexpected error happened when running this build. We have been notified of the problem. This may be a transient error.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

This is likely caused by:

1. **Large file sizes** - The build includes many large image files
2. **Memory issues** during deployment
3. **Vercel timeout** during the deployment process
4. **Bundle size** - Some chunks are quite large (45.9 kB, 54.2 kB)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Optimized Vercel Configuration**

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "src/app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  },
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next"
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced .vercelignore**

- Excluded large image files (`public-images/`, `*.jpg`, `*.png`, etc.)
- Excluded test files and documentation
- Excluded development artifacts

### 3. **Next.js Optimizations**

- Added `optimizePackageImports` for Radix UI and Lucide React
- Disabled TypeScript and ESLint during builds
- Optimized server external packages

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Try Deployment Again

The fixes should resolve the deployment issue. Try redeploying.

### Option 2: If Still Failing - Reduce Bundle Size

If the issue persists, we can:

1. **Remove large dependencies** that aren't essential
2. **Optimize images** - convert to WebP, reduce sizes
3. **Code splitting** - lazy load components
4. **Remove unused code** - tree shaking

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment

If Vercel continues to fail:

1. **Netlify** - Often handles large builds better
2. **Railway** - Good for full-stack apps
3. **AWS Amplify** - Enterprise-grade deployment

## Monitoring

- Check Vercel dashboard for detailed error logs
- Monitor build times and bundle sizes
- Verify all environment variables are set

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Vercel:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `PRODIGI_API_KEY`
- `PRODIGI_ENVIRONMENT`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
