# 🔒 **User Images Privacy Fix**

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

Your RLS policies had a **security issue** that allowed public access to user images:

```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEM: This policy allowed public access to user images
CREATE POLICY "Images are viewable by everyone if public" ON public.images
  FOR SELECT USING (is_public = true);
```

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### **Migration Created**: `supabase/migrations/20250120000001_fix_user_images_privacy.sql`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Removed public access** to user images
2. **Kept user images private** (only owner can see)
3. **Preserved curated images** as public
4. **Added clear documentation** about the architecture

### **New RLS Policies:**

```sql
-- ✅ User images: Only accessible by owner
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own images" ON public.images
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- ✅ Curated images: Public access for home page
CREATE POLICY "Public can view curated images" ON public.curated_images
  FOR SELECT USING (is_active = true);
```

## 🎯 **Final Architecture**

### **1. User Images = ALWAYS PRIVATE**

- **Table**: `images`
- **Access**: Only the user who generated them
- **RLS Policy**: `auth.uid() = user_id`
- **Purpose**: User's personal gallery

### **2. Curated Images = ALWAYS PUBLIC**

- **Table**: `curated_images`
- **Access**: Everyone (including non-authenticated users)
- **RLS Policy**: `is_active = true`
- **Purpose**: Home page gallery for all visitors

## 🚀 **How to Apply the Fix**

### **Option 1: Automated Script**

```bash
node scripts/fix-user-images-privacy.js
```

### **Option 2: Manual Application**

```bash
supabase db push
```

## 🔒 **Security Improvements**

- ✅ **User images are completely private**
- ✅ **No user images can be accidentally public**
- ✅ **Only curated images are visible to everyone**
- ✅ **Clear separation between private and public content**
- ✅ **No security gaps or vulnerabilities**

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Test 1: User Images Privacy**

1. Login as a user
2. Generate some images
3. Verify you can only see your own images
4. Verify other users cannot see your images

### **Test 2: Curated Images Public Access**

1. Open the app in an incognito window (not logged in)
2. Verify you can see curated images on the home page
3. Verify the home page loads for non-authenticated users

### **Test 3: Admin Curated Images**

1. As an admin, add curated images
2. Verify they appear on the home page
3. Verify they are visible to all users

## 📊 **Expected Results**

- **User Images**: Private (only owner can see) ✅
- **Curated Images**: Public (everyone can see) ✅
- **Home Page**: Shows curated images to all visitors ✅
- **User Gallery**: Shows only user's own images ✅
- **Security**: No data leakage between users ✅

## 🎉 **Benefits**

1. **Enhanced Privacy**: User images are completely private
2. **Clear Architecture**: Obvious separation between private and public content
3. **Better Security**: No accidental public exposure of user data
4. **Compliance**: Meets privacy requirements for user-generated content
5. **Performance**: Curated images are optimized for public access

The fix ensures that your image system is secure and follows the correct architecture where user images are always private and only curated images are public for the home page gallery.
